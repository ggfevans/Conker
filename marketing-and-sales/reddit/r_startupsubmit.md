## The Pitch

Imagine **Tamagotchi meets GitHub meets AI**:

- 🏠 Your pet lives in YOUR GitHub repo (you truly own it)
- 🤖 AI evolves it every night automatically (GPT-4o via GitHub Models)
- 🧬 Fork other people's monkeys to breed rare traits
- 🏆 Compete on a global leaderboard for highest rarity score
- 💰 **100% free forever** – runs entirely on GitHub's free tier

---

## Why I Built This

I wanted to explore "serverless" architecture taken to the extreme – **zero external infrastructure**:

- **GitHub Actions** = Backend (cron jobs, compute)
- **GitHub Pages** = Frontend hosting
- **GitHub Models** = AI provider (free tier)
- **Git commits** = Database (immutable history)

The result: a fully functional app with no servers, no databases, no monthly bills.
